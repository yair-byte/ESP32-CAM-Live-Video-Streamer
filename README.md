# ESP32-CAM-Live-Video-Streamer

Real-time video streaming for AI-Thinker's ESP32-CAM microcontroller. Use as few libraries as possible, just the basics for streaming video. The ESP is in AP mode.

To use it, you must first configure the variables found in the ESP32-CAM-Live-Video-Streamer.ino file in the corresponding section.

After this, we will connect from any device with WiFi to the ESP network. In the Web browser we will put the address http://192.168.4.1:80/video to start viewing the transmission:
